# Road-Network-Extraction
We have performed Road-Network-Extraction using classical Image processing and few libraries.

Two folders are attached to it 
1) PRE- We performed here various methods and steps and experimented a bit after reading various research paper.
We have stored the part we liked it includes loading the image and applying unsharp making via gaussian filter and then we performed canny edge detection.

2) Road-Network-Extraction-final- Here is the final project which include steps as 
*a*) Reading the image *b*) Image segmentation via K-means clustering *c*) Coverting image to grayscale image *d*) Thresholding using epsilon-neighbourhood *e*) Detect edges using laplacian-gradient method *f*) Overlay edge and original image

A perfect advanced algorithm for road extraction from satellite images.
